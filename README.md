# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project applies **Logistic Regression** to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient medical attributes.

## 📊 Dataset

We used the **UCI Heart Disease dataset**, which includes features like:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting blood sugar
- Max heart rate

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- **Logistic Regression**: a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification.
