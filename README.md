# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project applies **Logistic Regression** to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient medical attributes.

## 📊 Dataset

We used the **UCI Heart Disease dataset**, which includes features like:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting blood sugar
- Max heart rate
- And more...

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- **Logistic Regression**: a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification.

## ⚙️ Required Libraries

The project uses the following Python libraries:

| Library        | Description                                               |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `pandas`       | Data manipulation and analysis                            |
| `numpy`        | Numerical operations and array handling                   |
| `scikit-learn` | Machine learning model training and evaluation (LogReg)   |
| `matplotlib`   | Plotting basic graphs and visualizations                  |
| `seaborn`      | Statistical data visualization (correlation, heatmaps)    |

You can install them via:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
